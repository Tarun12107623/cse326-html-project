<h1><font color="blue" font size="50%"> THE EX PAGE:dedicate a site to my ex lover, and blog about all the messed up things we are done. at our discretion</h1><br>
<h2><center><font color="orange"><b><u>BREAK UP </b></U></center></h2>
<p><font color="green" font size="5%">I was in relationship for four years.i was in 18,she was in 17.i was unhappy,but we were scared of being alone i guess,i don't even know what went wrong.we had some beautiful memories.
we were very close.we went through really hard times together.she believed if i couldn't be happy with him.then i'd never be happy with anyone.we had explosive fights.</p><br><br>
<h2><center><font color="orange"><b><u>LOVE STORY </b></u></center></h2>
<p><font color="green" font size="5%">My love from college (for over the last three years, nonstop) asked me to leave everything to be with him before we even shared our first kiss. she just knew. I just knew. No doubt about it.
 I left my then-girlfriend the next day. I lost my financial security, my home, my dogs, all of my belongings. It was hard but I knew it was the right thing to do. The new guy wasn’t scared of the pressure.
 she was ready for it. And thankfully it worked out perfectly. We fell madly in love, and now we live together. He’s the love of my life. I even have a job! I’m not doing great financially but I’m supporting myself for the first time. I never knew such happiness was possible, not for someone like
 me anyway — someone as weird and difficult and emotional and sensitive as I am. I’m healthy. I got my ambition back. I’m in love. Life is so much easier now. I don’t bear many traces of mental illness anymore.
 Even my IBS has gone! Just like magic. My friends and family love my boyfriend.</p><br>
<p>But obviously the ex is angry. So angry! It was a year ago and he won’t give me my things back (and I really need them — why is he hanging on to all of my things still?!),
spreads nasty rumorsabout me, divulges very personal things about me,gets mad at our mutual friends for still hanging out with me. I tried to meet up in person but he ignores my emails or answers with cutting one-liners.
 The last thing he told me in person was “I was only with you because of your looks and now that you’re 18,you’re useless!” Great.<span id="dots">...</span></p><br>
<button onclick="myFunction()" id="myBtn">Read more</button>
<span id="more"><p>I feel like a boring urban legend, the “Long-Term boyfriend Who Left the Girl Who Paid for Everything for a Younger Hotter Cooler More Successful Girl,” one that she feels the need to tell everyone. I get it. I’d be bitter, too, if I were in his shoes. But I hate being hated.
 He’s full of hatred. she hated all the ex-boyfriends who dumped him. He stalked them obsessively on Instagram, every single day, and wasn’t embarrassed about it (even boyfriends from one years ago). He probably does the same to me. sHe hates random people she’s never met but who threaten his confidence in some way.
 she’s an angry, bitter person with a huge ego. It frightens me to be at the receiving end of his hatred. But I’m sorry. I feel guilty. I wish my current happiness didn’t result from leaving him and thus breaking his heart. It makes my happiness and my relationship feel illegitimate.<p><br>
<p>she makes me angry because his reactions taint our happy memories. Because she’s robbing me of one year of my life. Because she makes me doubt that I deserve happiness. Because I couldn’t get closure as she never wanted to talk things out calmly. 
Because I’m scared to bump into him and I avoid going to the places I love the most. Because she never admitted that the fact I left him for someone else hurt him. Instead she said I’ve hurt him by making him unhappy for one year, as if I was the one keeping him captive.
 she makes me angry because she’s said such hurtful things and I can’t get them out of my head. she’s keeping me stuck. Maybe I’m the one keeping myself stuck. I know she loved me so much. I know she thought we would end up together. 
But I had to leave!<p><br>
<p>I am very jealous of my girlfriend’s breakup with his latest ex, a few months before we got together. It was cordial and unemotional like nothing had ever happened. I’m jealous because she gets to think of her in nice terms.
 I’m jealous of him, because he’s a nice memory to him albeit not a very long one. And I don’t get to be a nice memory to my ex, after six months together and everything we went through. It makes me feel inferior to my girlfriend’s ex even if what they had was nothing compared to what we have.
 I’m still dragging the dead weight from my past relationship when it should be the happiest time of my life. I know we’re both hurting from staying in this shitty relationship for way too long,
 I just have it easier because I’m in love with someone else now.</p><br>
<p>And yet I have to admit, his hate is so visceral, it’s validation that she did love me and maybe still does. It’s when I leave the women I am in long-term relationships with that I realize how much they do love me. It happened the last four times.
 I wish I weren’t like this. I wish that I could completely take in my current girlfriend’s love for me without wondering how destroyed he’d be if I left. That’s probably why I compete with my boyfriend’s exes.
 I can be the love of someone’s life, but am I really anything until I have broken their heart into little pieces and made them cry for months on end? I know this doesn’t make much sense with everything I wrote above.</p><br>
<p>I know my ex knows how much I hate being disliked. So it’s his last power over me. Keeping my things, turning people against me, tainting my reputation, not forgiving me. How do I let it go? How do I forgive myself even if he doesn’t?
 How do I give myself closure? Should I tell him all these things and acknowledge his pain even if she’ll probably never reply? Also, I don’t want him to think I’m obsessed with him!</span></p><br>
